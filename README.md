I'm Azz-Rushman, currently learning Data Science and Python.

I don't have many projects done nor in mind, but I aim to get the skills needed to become a good asset for a team.

I started learning Python as of January 2023, and I believe I've grasped the basics of coding.
Currently working on learning SQL, Tableau & Power BI.
